- When deploying ingress pattern you need to tweak route server ips (maybe we can do this dynamically?)
- Add a test target in ansible that checks things from the client vm
- Have the ansible targets use the utility container
- Reorganize the charts (applications/components)
- Make sure we have externalTrafficPolicy: local on all the service objects
  (not sure this works now that we point the metallb network to a single random
  worker in the route table)
- Make cleanup work even when the west/east clusters have been deleted

- When deploying ingress pattern you need to tweak route server ips (maybe we can do this dynamically?)
- Add a test target in ansible that checks things from the client vm
- Add a couple of diagrams and a small readme (fix current diagram)
- Have the ansible targets use the utility container
- Move naming to west/east
- Fix metric on secondary nic on core/client
- Split off client vm from the core
  - Create third vpc
  - Add third nic to the core pointing to the client
  - Client will need a single nic and a public ip
  - Bonus points for a reverse proxy on the client
  - One static route towards the core
- Reorganize the charts (applications/components)
- Make sure we have externalTrafficPolicy: local on all the service objects

Nice to have:
- Figure out a solid way to always use the same addresses for the TORs workers NIC

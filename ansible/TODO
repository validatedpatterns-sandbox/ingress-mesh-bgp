- BFD is certainly broken on the client as it needs to use different local addresses


- When deploying ingress pattern you need to tweak route server ips (maybe we can do this dynamically?)
- Add the routes for the three workers on the spoke on the clients
- Check BFD with route server
- Add a test target in ansible that checks things from the client vm
- Create two separate subnets for the vm client instead of reusing existing ones?
